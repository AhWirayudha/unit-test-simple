## Test File Structure

### API Testing

- `__tests__/api-login.test.ts` - Tests login API endpoint
- `__tests__/api-profile.test.ts` - Tests profile API endpoint

### Component Testing

- `__tests__/login.test.tsx` - Tests login page component
- `__tests__/profile.test.tsx` - Tests profile page component

## Testing Configuration

### Jest Configuration Highlights

```javascript
{
  testEnvironment: "jsdom", // For React components
  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageReporters: ["json", "lcov", "text", "clover"],
  coverageDirectory: "coverage"
}
```

### Testing Libraries Used

- **Jest 30.0.2** - Testing framework
- **@testing-library/react 16.3.0** - React component testing utilities
- **@testing-library/jest-dom 6.6.3** - Custom Jest matchers
- **Supertest 7.1.1** - HTTP assertion library for API testing

## Key Findings

### Strengths

1. **API Routes:** Both login and profile APIs have perfect 100% coverage
2. **Profile Component:** Excellent coverage with only 1 uncovered branch
3. **Overall Metrics:** Strong coverage above 83% for all categories
4. **Test Structure:** Well-organized with separate tests for APIs and components

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Login Component Branch Coverage:** Only 41.17% branch coverage indicates missing test cases for conditional logic
2. **Login Component Function Coverage:** 57.14% suggests some functions are not being tested
3. **Missing Edge Cases:** The low branch coverage in login component suggests missing tests for error handling, form validation, or conditional rendering

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Improve Login Component Tests:**
   - Add tests for form validation scenarios
   - Test error handling and loading states
   - Cover conditional rendering paths
   - Test user interactions (form submission, input changes)

### Medium Priority

2. **Enhance Test Coverage:**
   - Aim for 95%+ branch coverage across all components
   - Add integration tests for complete user flows
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

### Low Priority

3. **Test Maintenance:**
   - Set up coverage thresholds in Jest configuration
   - Add pre-commit hooks to maintain coverage standards
   - Consider adding visual regression tests

## Coverage Report Generated

- **Date:** July 10, 2025 at 20:25:52 UTC
- **Tool:** Istanbul.js coverage tool
- **Format:** HTML report with interactive navigation

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates solid testing practices with excellent API coverage and good overall metrics. The main area requiring attention is the login component, which needs additional test cases to improve branch coverage from 41% to a target of 90%+. The testing infrastructure is well-established and ready for expansion.
